Here are some of my pet projects.

SimpleArgParse is a java project with ONE class. It is aimed as a simple command line argument parser. Much like argparse for python and Argparse4j. However, it is a lot simpler to use and because it is one class, there's no Maven nor jars to deal with for simple tasks.

More projects to come....
